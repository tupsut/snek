== Snek Game ==
- name redacted -

Basic features:
- The game is started by pressing the "Play" button. This generates the play
  field, the head of the snake, one element of food and initialises both
  the timers which control the snake's motion and record the time elapsed.
  The game then awaits for an input from the player.
  - The head of the snake is generated in the approximate centrepoint of the
    play field; the food element is placed via pseudorandom number generation
    where the seed is based on current Unix time. The default play field size
    is 20 x 20.
  - Colour is used to distinguish between the items on the play field, with
    food elements being black, the snake's head being lighter green and
    snake tail segments being darker green.
- Once the player presses one of the directional buttons (W/A/S/D; arrow keys
  have been implemented based on Qt docs but appear to not work), the snake
  begins moving in the given direction. The direction of the snake's motion
  can be changed by pressing another directional button. Pressing the button
  for the opposite direction (for example, pressing left when the snake is
  moving right) is ignored as it would result in instant loss of the game.
- Whenever the snake moves, a collision check is made to ensure that the
  snake's head has not collided with another part of the snake.
- If the snake's head arrives on the same point of the grid as the food
  element, the food is considered to be eaten. The following happens:
  - One point is added to the points tally.
  - The food element is moved to a new random location. If the location is
  found to be inside the snake, the element is moved again until a suitable
  location is found.
  - A new segment of the snake is created, initially located in the same
  point as the head of the snake. The segment becomes visible after the
  snake's head moves.
  - The timer controlling the snake is adjusted to be 5 ms faster than
  previously.
- The game has one win condition and one loss condition:
  - If the player succeeds in filling the entire grid with the snake's body
  such that there are no more viable spaces for the food to generate, the
  game is considered to be won.
  - If the player steers the snake such that it collides into another part of
  itself, the game is considered to be lost.
- In both cases, the game ends. All timers stop and a screen is presented,
  showing the win/loss status, the amount of points gathered, and the time
  elapsed. Following this, the player is prompted to enter a name for the
  purpose of saving the score. On some systems, the prompt autofills the
  current user account's name. If a name is not provided, the score is saved
  under the name "unknown".
- Certain buttons in the game window are only useable at certain times.
  The "Play" button is only used to start the game immediately after program
  execution; it is disabled following that. While a game is not started yet,
  the "Pause" and "Restart" buttons are inaccessible; after a game has
  finished, "Pause" becomes unavailable while "Restart" is available.

Additional features implemented:
- The snake's speed increases as the game proceeds, at a step of 5 ms/food.
- There is a high scores system, which records the best 10 scores into a
  text file in the program directory. High scores are ranked first by the
  amount of points (the more, the better) and then by the amount of time
  taken to achieve the point count (the less, the better). High scores can be
  seen inside the game by pressing the "High Scores" button.
- The game area is continuous/borderless - upon exiting the game area, the
  snake reappears on the opposite side of the game area.
- The width and height of the game area can be adjusted between games by
  pressing the "Field Size" button. The minimum size is 2, and the maximum is
  50.
- A Pause button is implemented, pausing the game progression as well as the
  internal timer. Upon clicking, it becomes a Resume button and allows the
  player to resume the game at will.
- A Restart button is implemented, which clears the game area and starts a
  new game immediately. This button is also used to start a new game after
  the player has finished the previous game.
- Game instructions and a brief introduction to the game are included inside
  the game, accessible by pressing the "How to Play" button.
